## 🔧 Working Principle

1. **Startup**: The Arduino initializes all sensors and motors.
2. **Navigation**: Using ultrasonic sensors, it detects obstacles and changes direction automatically.
3. **Cleaning**: Depending on setup, it either:
   - Sweeps using rotating brushes
   - Mops with a damp cloth/pad
4. **Loop**: The cycle repeats until the area is covered or power runs out.
